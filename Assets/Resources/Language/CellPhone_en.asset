      There are various causes, such as academics,

      the fundamental reasons why people get trapped in nightmares.


      In nightmares,
      the patient is the master of the dream, and if trapped for too long, there
      is a risk of never waking up.


      For this reason, nightmares are very
      dangerous, and they also inflict mental harm on the nightmare guides who enter
